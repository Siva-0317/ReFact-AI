What color is the sky?,blue,"The sky appears **blue** most of the time due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Sunlight:** Sunlight is made up of all the colors of the rainbow.
* **Earth's Atmosphere:**  Our atmosphere is made up of tiny gas molecules. When sunlight enters the atmosphere, these molecules scatter the light. 
* **Rayleigh Scattering:**  Blue light has a shorter wavelength than other colors, so it's scattered more strongly by the atmospheric gas molecules. This scattered blue light is what we see as the blue sky.

However, the sky's color can change depending on:

* **Time of day:** The sky appears redder at sunrise and sunset because the sunlight has to travel through more of the atmosphere to reach us.
* **Cloud Cover:** Clouds appear white or grey because they are made up of water droplets that scatter all colors of light equally.
* **Weather:** Haze, pollution, and dust can also affect the color of the sky.
